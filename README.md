I did not manage myself well this term.
Between final term graduation preparations and a new extracurricular I found a passion for but dedicated too much time to, I left myself scrambling to complete everything in the past couple weeks.
I managed to get through a good chunk of database integration, but simply starting up and connecting to the database is proving to be quite a challenge.
I think it stems from the fact that I accidentally chose a password that includes a special character and did not account for that correctly.
Either the password authentication fails or the special character makes the URL parser think the port starts earlier than it actually does.
I am giving up for now to finish as much as I can of another class' project.
I hope you understand or that we can meet up to discuss further what can or should be done about this.

Thank you.
